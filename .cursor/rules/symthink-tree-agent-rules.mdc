- [SymthinkTree.tsx](mdc:src/components/SymthinkTree.tsx) main entry component. All other library components are dependencies of this one and not intended to be directly exposed to the developer.
- [symthink.class.ts](mdc:src/core/symthink.class.ts) has the classes and interfaces representing the tree data structure used by the SymthinkTree component.
